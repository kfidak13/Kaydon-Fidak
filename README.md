# Kaydon-Fidak
I am from Upland, California, and my goal in Tech an Innovation Seminar is to learn more about creating.
Some experiences that have shaped me usually consist of community service, because I have learned to give to other rather than taking for myself.
Some things that excite me or even inspire me are people who can go in front of everyone and confidently deliver information without a second thought.
A major goal of mine is to make a project that I can reflect on in the distant future.
